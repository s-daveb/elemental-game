## ResourceEditor

As of now, there is only the one binary target, `ResourceEditor`. 
The goal is to create smaller sub-editor that share a common framework such that they can be used within the overarching ResourceEditor.

### Features of ResourceEditor

- Open and edit various types of game resources.
- User-friendly interface.
- Extensible framework for future types of files.
