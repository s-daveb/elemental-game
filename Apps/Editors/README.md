# Editors 
This folder contains the source code for various editors used in the development of elemental. Each program here is designed to facilitate the creation and modification of different resources used by elemental-based games.

## Current Status

**Important**: Please note that all the editors within this folder are a work in progress. The functionality and interfaces of these editors may change as development progresses.

## ResourceEditor

As of now, there is only the one binary target, `ResourceEditor`. 
The goal is to create smaller sub-editor that share a common framework such that they can be used within the overarching ResourceEditor.

### Features of ResourceEditor

- Open and edit various types of game resources.
- User-friendly interface.
- Extensible framework for future types of files.

### Screenshot

Coming soon.
