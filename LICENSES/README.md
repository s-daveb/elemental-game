Elemental would not be possible without the hard work, blood and sweat of other 
developers.  Here, you'll find copyright notices for works that are not my own,
but were instrumental in writing this software. 

Please see their respective webpages for the dependencies *their* software depends on.
I will try my best, but on different systems, different things might be pulled in.
